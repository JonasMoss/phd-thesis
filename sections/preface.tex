\section*{Acknowledgements}

Riccardo De Bin

Thanks to my co-supervisor Nils Lid Hjort. While we did not work much together on this thesis, your influence from the master thesis is strongly felt.

I am grateful to my coauthors. Especially Steffen Grønneberg, the unofficial third advisor of this thesis. It was a pleasure writing the partial identification paper with you and Njål Foldnes! And thanks to Martin Tveten, an excellent partner in \texttt{R}-package development. 

Sven Ove Samuelsen for being a pleasant boss and frequently correcting my misconceptions. Stephan Michelis, for his optimism and great comments about the \textit{p}-hacking paper. 

Jonas Christoffer Lindstrøm. We have spent countless hours discussing statistics, often directly influencing this, usually over a couple of beers, and often together with Céline Cunén. Emil Stoltenberg, for many deep discussions, particularily about Bayesian statistics, and reading through the infinite confidence interval paper. Vinnie Ko for being an inspiration in getting things done and double-checking some maths in the standardized alpha paper.

Kjersti Moss, for fixing much of my bad writing and listening to me going on and on about esoteric and fundamentally uninteresting topics.

Olav Dovland, my mentor in mathematics the last 10 years or so.

Moreover, I would like to express my appreciation of the members the causality reading group. We didn't get around to write a paper, but I hope we will in the future. The members of the Psychological Methods Research Group should not be left out. Posts in this group were the seeds of two papers in this thesis and two papers that are not finished yet.
